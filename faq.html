    How this app works, what your role means, and how your data stays yours.

<main id="faqList">

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h2>How does the role system work?</h2>
    <p>
      The role system uses your answers from the
      <a href="role_finder.html">Find Your Role</a> questionnaire to calculate
      which of the <a href="role_list.html">15 civic roles</a> best matches your
      skills, interests, and physical readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the scenes, your answers are converted into scores across several
      <a href="glossary.html#category">categories</a> like
      <strong>Information Flow</strong>, <strong>Supplies & Resource Management</strong>,
      and <strong>Mutual Aid & Support</strong>. The highest‑scoring category
      determines your primary role, and that role is assigned a unique
      <a href="glossary.html#role-number">Role Number</a> for quick reference.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h2>What is a Role Number?</h2>
    <p>
      A <a href="glossary.html#role-number">Role Number</a> is a unique ID that
      ties you to a specific civic role, like <strong>#1 Signal Runner</strong>
      or <strong>#10 Chronicler</strong>. It makes it easy to form balanced
      teams quickly—if you know you have a #4, #7, and #12 in a group, you
      instantly know you have supplies, logistics, and media covered.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h2>What are categories and why do they matter?</h2>
    <p>
      Each role belongs to a broader
      <a href="glossary.html#category">Category</a>, such as
      <strong>Information Flow</strong> or <strong>Logistics & Planning</strong>.
      Categories help you understand not just what you do, but how you fit into
      a larger civic system. When multiple people share their roles, you can
      quickly see which categories are strong and which are missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can explore all categories and their roles on the
      <a href="categories.html">Role Categories</a> page.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h2>Is my data private?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. All data is stored locally on your device only. The app does not send
      your answers, runs, or badges to any server. There is no login, no cloud
      sync, and no hidden network calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can confirm this by reviewing the
      <a href="glossary.html#local-storage">Local Storage</a> entry in the
      glossary and by exporting your data from the
      <a href="data_export.html">Export / Import Data</a> page to see exactly
      what is stored.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h2>Do I need internet to use this app?</h2>
    <p>
      You only need internet once—to load or install the app. After that, the
      app is designed to run fully offline using your browser’s
      <a href="glossary.html#pwa">PWA</a> and
      <a href="glossary.html#service-worker">Service Worker</a> capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you lose connection, the app will still open, your data will still be
      available, and core pages will still function. If a page can’t load, you
      will see the <a href="offline.html">Offline</a> or
      <a href="error.html">Error</a> page instead of a blank screen.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h2>What are badges and how do I earn them?</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="glossary.html#badge">Badges</a> are distinctions you earn by
      passing specific <a href="tests_home.html">Math & Science Trials</a>.
      Each test has its own badge—for example, passing the arithmetic trial
      might grant you a <strong>Arithmetic Adept</strong> badge, while passing
      the combined science trial might grant you a
      <strong>Systems Observer</strong> badge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Badges appear on your <a href="profile.html">Profile</a> and help you
      signal extra skills when forming teams.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h2>What is the 1‑Mile Run Tracker for?</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="run_tracker.html">1‑Mile Run Tracker</a> is a simple way to
      measure your physical readiness over time. Your best mile time is stored
      locally and displayed on your <a href="profile.html">Profile</a> and
      <a href="share_card.html">Share Card</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glossary entry for <a href="glossary.html#run-tracker">Run Tracker</a>
      explains how times are stored, how history is logged, and how this data
      is used in the app.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h2>What is the Share Card?</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="share_card.html">Share Card</a> is a visual summary of your
      role, role number, category, and best mile time. It’s designed to be
      saved as an image and shared in group chats, printed, or used in
      in‑person meetups.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glossary entry for <a href="glossary.html#share-card">Share Card</a>
      breaks down each field and how it’s generated.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h2>Can I reset everything and start over?</h2>
    <p>
      Yes. On the <a href="settings.html">Settings</a> page, you can choose to
      reset all local data. This clears your role, run history, badges, and
      any other stored information. The glossary entry
      <a href="glossary.html#data-reset">Data Reset</a> explains exactly what
      is removed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="faq-item">
    <h2>Where can I see definitions of all these terms?</h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a> is the central reference for all
      key concepts in this app: <a href="glossary.html#role-number">Role Number</a>,
      <a href="glossary.html#category">Category</a>,
      <a href="glossary.html#badge">Badge</a>,
      <a href="glossary.html#run-tracker">Run Tracker</a>,
      <a href="glossary.html#pwa">PWA</a>,
      <a href="glossary.html#service-worker">Service Worker</a>, and more.

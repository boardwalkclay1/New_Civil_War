    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This app helps users discover their civic role, track their fitness,
      learn history, and test their knowledge — all offline and stored locally.

    <h2>Offline Layers</h2>
    <p>
      The app is built in layers: identity, role assignment, tests, history,
      run tracking, and badges — all functioning without internet.
